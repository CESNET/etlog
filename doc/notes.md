# etlog - eduroam trafic log analysis

## Basic info

etlog can be accessed on [etlog.cesnet.cz](https://etlog.cesnet.cz). It gathers and analyzes national radius log files
generated by [eduroam](http://eduroam.cz) service and presents them to the users.
etlog is intended for both users and administrators.

Some of the main reasons to create etlog were:
- create generic interface for processing, analysis and searching of the radius log files
- create a system for generating statistics and reports
- create a system for trend analysis, which can signal service problems
- create a system for anomaly detection (authnetication errors, device or identity theft, .. )

etlog is a web application, which consists of Node.js, Express web application framework and MongoDB.

## Server setup

The application is setup on Debian jessie. It is running as user etlog and it's root is in /home/etlog/etlog/.
It is listening for incoming connections on port 8080 for http connections and 
on port 8443 for https connections. Http connections are automatically redirected to https.
Successful redicretion requires HTTP 1.1 host header.

### Network setup

Application is running by unprivileged user, so he can not use standard http and https port.
Instead ports 8080 and 8443 are used.
Automatic port redirection to ports 8080 and 8443 is provided through iptables.
Persistence of rules is ensured by iptables-persistent debian package:
```
apt-get install iptables-persistent
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80  -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8443
iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
ip6tables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp -d 2001:718:1:1f:50:56ff:feee:150/64 --dport 80  -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
ip6tables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp -d 2001:718:1:1f:50:56ff:feee:150/64 --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8443
ip6tables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v6
```

### Syslog setup

Radius data are acquired through syslog. Installation and configuration:

```
cd /etc/ssl/certs/
wget https://crt.cesnet-ca.cz/CESNET_CA_Root.pem
wget https://crt.cesnet-ca.cz/CESNET_CA_3.pem
c_rehash
apt-get install syslog-ng
cat > /etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/etlog-fticks.conf
source net {
  tcp(
    port(1999)
    tls( ca_dir("/etc/ssl/certs")
    key-file("/home/etlog/etlog/cert/etlog.cesnet.cz.key.pem")
    cert-file("/home/etlog/etlog/cert/etlog.cesnet.cz.crt.pem"))
  );
};

destination fticks { file("/home/etlog/logs/fticks/fticks-$YEAR-$MONTH-$DAY" owner("etlog") group("etlog") perm(0600)); };

log { source(net); destination(fticks); };
^D
service syslog-ng restart

su - etlog
mkdir -p ~/logs/{fticks,transform,mongo}
```

The code above installs certificates required for syslog tls connection.
Next part installs syslog-ng and creates it's configuration.
last part creates directories `/home/etlog/logs/fticks`, `/home/etlog/logs/transform`
and `/home/etlog/logs/mongo`.
Log files created by syslog are located in `/home/etlog/logs/fticks`.

### Cron setup

Cron is used to run tasks periodically.
Setup is done in application for application logic and in user's
crontab for incoming log importing.

#### System

User's crontab can be edited by using `crontab -e`.
Script for data importing may be run every 5 minutes by adding code below.
```
*/5 *  *   *   *     /home/etlog/etlog/scripts/cron.sh
```

#### Node.js

Setup is defined in cron.js.
Table below defined how tasks are run.
Every task generates data for collection of the same name.

| task name        |              interval            |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| failed\_logins   |      every day at 02:05:00       |
| invalid\_records |      every day at 02:10:00       |
| mac\_count       |      every day at 02:15:00       |
| roaming          |      every day at 02:20:00       |
| users\_mac       |      every 15 minutes            |

TODO - mail

### Mail setup

Mail is handled by postfix mail server. 
Postfix configuration type is set up as Internet site.
Listeting only on localhost address is done with 
`inet_interfaces = 127.0.0.1` in /etc/postfix/main.cf


#### Node.js

Setup is done with nodemailer package in file mail.js.


### Packages

These packages are necessary for etlog to run:

openssl
git
tmux
htop
iptables-persistent
curl
tmux
make
syslog-ng
gawk
logtail
postfix
mailutils

Other special packages along with installation are listed below.
  
  
### MongoDB

MongoDB is document oriented database.

#### installation

At the time of writing this guide, no official documentation for installation on Debian jessie
is available.

```
apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv EA312927
echo "deb http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/debian jessie/mongodb-org/3.2 main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-3.2.list
apt-get install mongodb-org
systemctl enable mongod
service mongod start
```

#### Configuration

Disable THP by following guide from official [docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/transparent-huge-pages/).
No further configuration should be needed.


#### Time data

MongoDB stores all time data as Date data type, which stores time in UTC.
This present issue when incoming data have localtime which has offset against UTC
Official MongoDB [docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/model-time-data/) say that:
> MongoDB stores times in UTC by default, and will convert any local time representations into this form. Applications that must operate or report on some unmodified local time value may store the time zone alongside the UTC timestamp, and compute the original local time in their application logic.

Data will be reconstructed to original time when presenting to the user.
Conversion in aggregation pipeline from UTC to localtime can be done using:

```
db.roaming.aggregate([
{ 
  $project :
    {
      _id : 0, 
      inst_name: 1, 
      timestamp : 
      { 
        $add : [ "$timestamp", 7200000 ]          // convert UTC to localtime
      }
        // offset is -2 hours
        // => 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000
        // 2 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds * 1000 miliseconds
    }
},
], function (err, items) {
  respond(err, items, res)
});
```

#### Usage

Database can be accessed by command `mongo`.  
Data are divided into databases, same as in the sql dabases. Each database consists of collections,
which is equivalent of sql tables. Collections consist of documents, which use the BSON notation, which is basen on JSON.

Basic commands:

`show databases` lists all databases which are available.

`use my_database` swich current database to my\_database

`show collections` lists collection for current database.

`db.my_collection.find({})` display all documents in my\_collection

`db.my_collection.find({}).limit(5)` display 5 document from my\_collection

`db.my_collection.find({})limit(5).pretty()` display 5 nicely formatted documents from my\_collection


### Node.js

Node.js is server-side JavaScript.
Because the version of Node.js available in Debian jessie is very old (0.10.29~dfsg-2),
installation of newer version is needed. 
At the time of writing this guide current version of Node.js is 6.5.

### installation

```
apt-get install curl
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | bash -
apt-get install nodejs
```


## Application internals

etlog consists of Node.js, Express web application framework and MongoDB.
It uses many auxiliary javascript modules.
All the necesarry modules including their specific version can be found in file **package.json**.

### Database

Application uses database etlog.
Database is separated into several collections.

#### Collections

In the tables below the column note is just explanatory, it is not really present in the database.
Every document has also a field _id, which is just for internal MongoDB purposes, it is not shown in tables below.

##### logs

Collection represents raw radius log records transformed to json format. 
For details on data transformation see scripts/fticks\_to\_bson.sh

| field name | data type |               note               |
|------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| timestamp  |   Date    |      timestamp of authentication |
| realm      |   String  |      domain part of username     |
| viscountry |   String  |      visited country             |

| csi        |   String  |      mac address                 |
| pn         |   String  |      username                    |
| result     |   String  |      result of authentication    |

##### users\_mac

Collection defines binding between user and all mac addresses, which he used for successfull authentication to eduroam.

| addrs      |   Array   |      array of user's mac addresses  |


##### privileged\_ips

Collection containing privileged ip addresses, which will bypass
saml authentication. Address authentication is done using module passport-ip.
Addresses must be in commonly used slash format:

ipv4 addresses format:

```
'192.168.1.1/32'
'10.0.0.0/8'
```

ipv6 addresses format:

```
'2001:718:2:1::1/128'
'2001:718:2:1::/64'
```

| field name | data type |               note               |
|------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| ip         |   String  |  string representing ip address  |


###### data insertion/update

After data update, the application must be restarted.
Privileged ip addresses are loaded only on application startup.
Localhost address is added for cron tasks to use application api.
Data can be inserted by accesing mongo shell and using commands:

```
use etlog
db.privileged_ips.insert({ip : '127.0.0.1/32'})
db.privileged_ips.insert({ip : '192.168.1.1/32'})
```

### Gulp

Gulp is a build system, which can be used for variuos tasks.

#### Instalation

Gulp must be installed globally by root user by typing:
```
npm install -g gulp-cli
```

#### Usage

Everything that gulp does is defined in gulpfile.js.
After defining tasks, they can be run bu using `gulp`.
Gulp is used to generate html files from pug templating language.
Pug files are in `views/templates/`, html output is in `public/partials`.


### Log files 

Everything related to log files is located in /home/etlog/logs.

```
  /home/etlog/logs           - log files root
  |-- fticks                 - directory with log files and offset files
  |-- last_date              - file with date of last processed log file 
  |-- mongo                  - directory with log files generated by mongoimport
  |-- transform              - directory with files related to transformation from F-Ticks to BSON
      `-- err-*              - file containing line numbers of invalid records
      `-- last_*             - file containing number of last processed line of corresponding log file
```

#### New data

Incoming syslog data are processed by `scripts/cron.sh` and subsequently by `scripts/fticks_to_bson.sh`.
Data are converted from F-Ticks format (for more see [this](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-johansson-fticks-00.html)) to BSON.

Data are processed every 5 minutes by user's crontab.
Last date file (`/home/etlog/logs/last_date`) contains date of last processed log file.
File is updated every day, when the last part of the data is imported.

Last file for every processed log file contains last processed line number.
File on every cron job run. It is used to calculate absolute line numbers for error reporting.

#### Error files

Transform error log like has this structure:
`filename:line number:error reason`
Transform error log file may look like:

```
/home/etlog/logs/fticks/fticks-2016-10-20:681871: skipped, general error in parsing current record
/home/etlog/logs/fticks/fticks-2016-10-20:682504: skipped, general error in parsing current record

```

### API

#### api-query-params

For easy use mapping from query string to MongoDB queries is used.
Module api-query-params is used for this functionality.
Official [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/api-query-params) provides full information how to use.
Module is slightly modified to support various timestamps and for correct mapping of them to backend api.

Table below defines operators usage:

| URI                  | example                | explanation            |
|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|

| `key>val`            | `count>5`              | greater                |
| `key>=val`           | `rating>=9.5`          | greater or equal       |
| `key<val`            | `createdAt<2016-01-01` | lower                  |
| `key<=val`           | `score<=-5`            | lower or equal         |

| `key=val1,val2`      | `country=GB,US`        | equal to all listed    |
| `key!=val1,val2`     | `lang!=fr,en`          | not equal to all listed|
| `key`                | `phone`                | exists                 |
| `!key`               | `!email`               | not exists             |
| `key=/value/<opts>`  | `email=/@gmail\.com$/i`| reqex equal            |
